<p> Shown in the image above the ECDL model calculates the electrical demand (kWH) of a POI location based upon a variety of socio-economic and transportation related demographics. As such it is an iterative process and the electrical demand is calculated for each age group and POI type.</p>

<p> In the example shown above the electrical demand of the 15-24 year (g1) Age Group and Living (p1) POI type are calculated using the ECDL formula. The result or electric demand for the Age Group and POI type are represented as E g1,p1 and are in total kilo-watt hours (kWh).</p>
