<h2>Project Background</h2>
<ul>
  <li>In recent times, discussion about climate change and its effects have become more pronounced. Policy makers and industry leaders alike have responded by legislating regulations that seek to gradually limit the amount of Green House Gas emission (GHG) released into the atmosphere each year.</li>
  
  <li>In 2021, President Biden enacted executive orders to begin planning for a transition of federal automobile vehicles to be zero-emission by 2035 (White House, 2021) in order to limit the amount of GHG emissions produced by light-duty vehicles.On the state level in the United States, “California, Colorado, Connecticut, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, and Washington have also committed to adopting similar zero-emission standards” (Shields, 2021). The private automotive sector of the U.S. has responded by also releasing long-term manufacturing plans to transition vehicle production from Internal Combustible Engine Vehicles (ICEVs) to Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) within the coming decades (Riley, 2019; Weyland, 2021) .</li>
  
  <li>The supporting evidence for these measures has been that the disproportionate share of GHG emissions are produced by private light-duty vehicles. Within the U.S. transportation sector over 59% of total GHG emissions are emitted by private light-duty vehicles (EPA, 2015).</li>
